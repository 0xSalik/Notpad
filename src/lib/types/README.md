You can use Quicktype if you need to convert JSON to TypeScript types, such as in the case of API responses. For example, we used the GitHub API response to convert to TypeScript types using the Quicktype website.

Quicktype is a tool that converts JSON data into strongly-typed TypeScript interfaces. You can find more information about Quicktype at [Quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/?l=ts).
